## Executive Summary <a name="executivesum"></a>
The implementation of “wellness programs” alongside life insurance products is becoming increasingly popular as the benefits become recognised by insurers and policyholders alike. These programs provide a way for policyholders to reduce their premiums or gain rewards by making healthier choices, and in doing so, decrease mortality risk for insurers and offer a means of attracting new customers. 

This report details StatSmart Solution’s proposals for SuperLife’s wellness program in Lumaria, with actuarial justification and analysis. Our team proposes four main initiatives to reduce expected mortality, increase life insurance sales, add economic value for SuperLife, and incentivise healthy behaviours. These initiatives – namely Earn (financial incentives for healthy behaviours), Screen (preventative screening incentives), Prevent (cancer prevention initiatives) and Quit (smoking cessation programs) – will be offered via a SuperLife mobile app. This app will allow customers to log evidence of healthy behaviours, access rewards, and track their progress. 

Under StatSmart’s proposed plan, we expect SuperLife to have saved Č4.6B if they had implemented this program for the past 23 years. These savings arise from the decreased mortality risk that each program generates, which gives rise to lower benefit payouts and lower liabilities going forwards, as well as income from new policyholders attracted by the wellness program. 

A sensitivity analysis shows that the wellness program would have improved SuperLife’s economic value with almost 100% certainty. Key risks include participation risk, technology risk, pricing risk and ethical risks, among others. StatSmart has proposed several strategies for mitigating these risks by either reducing, transferring, removing, or self-insuring it. 

## 2.	Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
### 2.1 Main Objectives <a name="mainobjectives"></a>
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives:
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives: 
1.	Improve policyholder health and wellness through participation in the wellness plan
2.	Decrease expected mortality of policyholders 
3.	Increase sales of SuperLife’s life insurance products 
4.	Add economic value to SuperLife
5.	Increase competitiveness and marketability of products. 
While all five objectives are fulfilled through StatSmart’s proposal, the former three are the primary focus of the program design. The latter two objectives are achieved inherently: our findings show that the benefits of decreased mortality and increased customer base outweigh the program costs, leading to higher overall revenue, thereby providing SuperLife with higher economic value and better competitiveness than if this wellness plan had not been implemented. 

### 2.2 Key metrics & timelines <a name="keymetrics"></a>
The success of each incentive, and of the overall program, is primarily measured by the financial savings it would have afforded SuperLife over the past 23 years, relative to the status of no interventions. These savings consist of two parts: increased profits from current policyholders due to lower mortality causing reduced claim frequency, and additional profit from new policyholders joining due to the wellness program offerings. Naturally, the interventions all require cash outflows to fund their implementation and maintenance, but our calculations show that these expenses are outweighed by the savings. Next, timelines can be divided into setup, delivery and evaluation. The set-up of a mobile app to deliver the incentives, as explained in the following sections, will take conservatively 9 to 12 months considering its highly complex features (Srivastava 2023). Each individual incentive is then delivered through the app to the policyholders. Monitoring should be conducted regularly – for example every 3 to 6 months – to ensure that the app is well-used, taking on board policyholder feedback. Updates and general maintenance should occur continuously. The results of the program on policyholder mortality, claim pay-outs and new sales may take 2 to 3 years to be noticed, and even longer, up to 10 or more years, for the full effects to be felt. However, monitoring must still be conducted quarterly or even monthly to ensure assumptions are in line with expectations. 

### 3. Program Design <a name="programdesign"></a>
The StatSmart team have designed a program for SuperLife insurance that encompasses two incentive-based interventions and two mortality-based interventions. To decide on the best interventions, StatSmart performed a cost-benefits analysis on each of the 50 interventions, with the aim of identifying the top 10 interventions in terms of benefits for their respective cost. After selecting the top 10 using the cost benefits analysis, the team utilised the team’s exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the final four interventions. The final four interventions are outlined below.

### 3.1 Earn: Financial Incentives for Healthy Behaviour <a name="earn"></a>
Leveraging the rising trend of technology literacy in Lumaria, a gamified point system with financial incentives will be integrated within a new SuperLife app to encourage policyholders to live healthier lifestyles. Circulatory diseases are one of the leading contributors to policyholder deaths, responsible for 77% of all non-smoker deaths in the SuperLife dataset. The World Health Organization (WHO) (2015) states that more than 80% of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable by behavioural choices, including sustaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and blood pressure control via check-ups. As such, Earn aims to incentivise healthy behaviours to create long-term impact.

Earn will recognise six categories of healthy activities that when tracked and verified, allocates users with points, shown in table below. Each activity has a yearly limit according to the recommended frequency, for example, an annual health screening being sufficient for the general population. However, activities like walking 12,000 steps a day and purchasing fresh foods can be logged every day and every week respectively, as these healthy habits promote lifestyle change and address overall wellness by increasing activity rates and micronutrient intake.

All users automatically start at the Blue tier, where they can gradually rank up to Platinum, which has a reward worth Č80. At the start of a new year, all users’ tiers are reset to Blue, ensuring the maximum monetary reward is capped at Č80 and users are incentivised to complete annual check-ups. The points to Crown conversions were devised to match SuperLife’s provided intervention costs, while ensuring the activity effort required is proportional to the awards.
Based on the tier, customers can redeem rewards of a value up to the cost indicted in the table above. These rewards are from partnered businesses, which will initially start with shopping vouchers, wearable device discounts and flight cashbacks. Financial incentives through gamified app scenarios will encourage user satisfaction and participation, as well as improving life expectancy as seen in John Hancock’s ‘Vitality’ program (Vitality, 2018). See Appendix B.2 for more information on partnerships and benefits. 

### 3.2. Screen: Incentives for Preventive Screenings <a name="screen"></a>
The majority of the leading causes of death for SuperLife’s policyholders such as cancer and diseases of the circulatory system are preventable or can be delayed by undertaking preventive health screenings and check-ups. This is especially true when the factors and symptoms that can lead to disease may not be obvious, spotted early or seen at all until it is too late. Thus, health screenings allow policyholders to identify issues with their health before symptoms develop, to reduce risk (TAL, 2021). General health check-ups often include pathology tests such as blood tests which can also prevent diseases and identify risk factors, allowing doctors to provide advice and improve an individual’s health. Discovering diseases early will also increase the quality and length of life. 

Thus, one of the activities that is included in the rewards program is undertaking check-ups and preventive health screenings which will ensure a 5-10% reduction in mortality. The number of points awarded when a policyholder does a preventive screening or check-up allows them to automatically move up a tier. This allows them to get better rewards which will encourage participation in this intervention, but costs little to SuperLife as most screenings can only be done once every 2 years or more. 
SuperLife will only award points to policyholders if they get a general health check-up or a cancer screening, but only if they meet the criteria outlined in Appendix B.3.2. These screenings are for cervical, bowel, breast, lung and colorectal cancers. Please see Appendix B.3.1 on explanation as to why these cancers were chosen. Policyholders can gain points and thus financial rewards, by reporting through the app that they have done the preventive screening. This is done by consenting to share their private medical results and uploading documentation or results of their specific health screening. Otherwise, these medical examinations must be done at medical centres that have partnerships with SuperLife to confirm that the policyholders have done the screening in question.

|     Mortality Adjustment                      |     88% for the general population and 811%   when modelling for smokers only                                                           |     Between 2001 and 2023, the observed   mortality was 12% lower than the rates predicted by Lumaria Mortality Table.   Consequently, we have recalibrated the mortality rates by applying a factor   of 88%, ensuring the mortality table aligns with the empirical data as a   baseline before applying any Mortality Improvements. This factor escalates to   811% when only smokers are modelled.                                                                                                                     |
|     Mortality   Improvement                   |     5-10% for Preventive Screening 5-10% for Cancer   Prevention     2-5% for Financial Incentives      35-65% for Smoking Cessation    |     To see the impact of each intervention, we   have simulated three scenarios of mortality improvement based on the provided   ranges in the Interventions Data file. Note that although the information   provided by SuperLife suggests a maximum mortality improvement of 50% for   smoking cessation, several studies globally have shown that 50% is in fact an   average improvement, supporting our use of this value as a best estimate   rather than an upper limit (US Surgeon General, 2020; Pierce, 2022)    |
|     Participation Rates                       |     21% for Preventive Screening     45% for Cancer Prevention     37% for Financial Incentives     50% for Smoking Cessation           |     Based on research indicated in section 3.1   to 3.4 and Appendix B, we have assumed medium participation in each program   as a baseline for modelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|     Discount Rate                             |     2.0519%                                                                                                                             |     Utilizing the provided 1-year risk-free   annual spot rates from 2001-2023, we derived a single, consolidated discount   rate. This rate, weighted by the actual cash flows, effectively replicates   the present value that would have been obtained using the variable yearly   rates. This approach simplifies modelling and facilitates sensitivity   analysis.                                                                                                                                                    |
|     App Development and   Maintenance Cost    |     Initial Value = Č 5,000,000     Per year cost = Č 2,000,000     Present Value (2.0519% discount rate) = Č100M                       |     Based on the article from DreamWalk (Russell,2023),   the average cost to develop an app was between $45,000 and $240,000. However,   it is mentioned that large companies spend millions of dollars a year to develop   and maintain apps. Therefore, a conservative estimate of 5,000,000 upfront   and 2,000,000 per year was calculated as the cost of the app.                                                                                                                                                    |

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Transparency Risk      |     SuperLife must inform users about how   sensitive data is handled, including how the data is collected, used and who   has access to it, including third parties. For example, users should be   informed about how their data issued if data is shared with partnered   companies.                                                                                     |     Privacy policies must be transparent,   informative, and easily accessible. Policyholders must be made aware of where   their data is being used, and whether it is being shared with third parties,   to prevent them from unknowingly sharing their data without understanding the   implications. SuperLife’s legal team can assist with this. Additionally, an   ethical framework must be developed to cover this and other ethical   risks.      |
|     Data Privacy Risk      |     Sensitive data will be collected from   individuals who participate in these programs, such as their medical records   used to claim points. Data breaches could lead to fraud, identity theft and   other regulatory and ethical issues.                                                                                                                               |     Along with the ethical framework, SuperLife   must implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data. Regular   tests and checks of this security system must be conducted. Sensitive data   should only be accessible for those who require it, and measures should be   taken to anonymise and remove or encrypt sensitive information when sharing   the data.                                                                           |
|     Consent Risk           |     While SuperLife’s app aims to encourage   healthy habits, policyholders may inadvertently reveal sensitive details   about their lifestyle, health conditions, or habits through logging their   activities for points. The trends revealed may not align with the terms and   conditions of the written consent form they fill out prior to participation.             |     As with the transparency risk, privacy   policies and consent forms must be clear and understandable for   policyholders. Policyholders should be fully aware of what they are   consenting to, and SuperLife should continually monitor the data they are   receiving to ensure that no unnecessary data is collected. Regulatory   guidance can also assist in this regard.                                                                          |
|     Discrimination Risk    |     SuperLife encourages participation in   healthy activities which may not be accessible to certain policyholders like   those with health conditions or disabilities. Policyholders with higher   socioeconomic status, better access to healthcare and more leisure time for   leisure are more advantaged in completing activities and thus financial   incentives.    |     As the wellness program is implemented and   further developed, SuperLife can add additional incentives targeted towards   these discriminated population groups, such as assistance with chronic   diseases. Further, premium discounts (which may be introduced in the future   of the wellness program) can make the program more accessible for those with   lower socioeconomic status.                                                           |

### 6.2 Main Risks <a name="mainrisks"></a>

|     Risk                     |     Description                                                                                                        |     Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|     Participation risk       |     The proportion of policyholders who   participate in the wellness program is significantly lower than expected.    |     The inherent design of the program to   target several different health-based incentives which can be personalised   per policyholder reduces the risk of low participation. The sensitivity   analysis shows that profits will still be made even if participation is lower   than expected. Data analytics and consumer feedback can be used to improve   participation once the program is implemented, if need be.     |
|     Mortality Impact Risk    |     The risk that the mortality impact of the   applied interventions is not in line with expectation.                 |     Monitoring mortality changes will allow   SuperLife to identify lower-than-expected mortality improvements.   Collaborating with doctors, wellness experts and researchers can provide   additional ideas on how to assist policyholders in reducing their mortality   risk.                                                                                                                                               |
|     Pricing Risk             |     The risk that the prices and costs   calculated by the StatSmart team are incorrect.                               |     Consistently (e.g. every quarter) monitor   premium income vs cash outflows to ensure expenses and income is in line with   expected; re-price if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     Technology risk          |     The program relies heavily on both the   development and ongoing maintenance of the app.                           |     IT specialists within SuperLife will need   to focus on ensuring that the app is working smoothly. Several redundancy and   backup mechanisms must be in place. In the event of critical system failure,   failover mechanisms and recovery protocols must be in place.                                                                                                                                                    |

|                                |     Min                          |     Max       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|     Discount Rate              |     3,981                        |     5,117     |     The   results are desirable for any range of discount rate if the cost and savings   are modelled using a consistent discount rate. The min and max scenarios were   1% higher and 1% lower than the provided discount rate (i.e. rates of 1.05%   to 3.05%)                                                               |
|     Participation Level        |     3,585                        |     5,801     |     The   results are desirable within all the simulated participation levels, which   range from 18% to 60%, if the cost and savings are modelled using a   consistent participation level. The participation levels used for this   analysis can be found in Appendix E.3.                                                   |
|     Ongoing Costs              |     3,886                        |     5,906     |     The   overall results are desirable within all the simulated cost levels, shown in   Appendix C.1-4. However, when evaluating each intervention solely, the cost   of the Financial Incentives program will exceed its savings only in the   high-cost scenario.                                                           |
|     Mortality   Improvement    |     2,405                        |     7,120     |     The   overall results are desirable within the simulated mortality improvement   range, shown in Appendix C.1-4. However, when evaluating each intervention   solely, only the savings in the low mortality improvement scenario of the   Financial Incentives program will be insufficient to cover the program cost.     |

### 7. Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

|     Limitation                       |     Description                                                                                        |     Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Premium Data                     |     Data   relating to how premiums were priced, and their prices, was not included.                   |     Assumptions   were required to calculate the benefits of our interventions. It was   impossible to confidently use premium discounts as an incentive.                                                     |
|     Data definitions                 |     Data   definitions were not clear, especially in the srcsc-2024-interventions excel   document.    |     The   StatSmart team had to use their best judgement to define costs and mortality   improvements for their interventions                                                                                 |
|     Cause of Death                   |     Cause   of death data was quite broad, and was not specific to the exact illness.                  |     This   limited the StatSmart team’s ability to completely tailor their solution to   the country of Lumaria                                                                                               |
|     Lumaria   Encyclopaedia Entry    |     The   Lumaria encyclopaedia entry was not very easy to apply.                                      |     There   was no simple way to find similar economies to Lumaria. StatSmart used the US   as a comparison.                                                                                                  |
|     Policyholder   Data              |     There   was limited data on the policyholders.                                                     |     There   was very limited data that StatSmart could use to infer the mortality of the   policyholders.     There   was no policyholder behaviour data i.e. how much they used the SuperLife   website.     |
|     SuperLife   data                 |     There   was no data on SuperLife                                                                   |     It   was impossible to understand SuperLife’s full offerings and potential to pair   with other products.                                                                                                 |
