## Executive Summary <a name="executivesum"></a>
The implementation of “wellness programs” alongside life insurance products is becoming increasingly popular as the benefits become recognised by insurers and policyholders alike. These programs provide a way for policyholders to reduce their premiums or gain rewards by making healthier choices, and in doing so, decrease mortality risk for insurers and offer a means of attracting new customers. 

This report details StatSmart Solution’s proposals for SuperLife’s wellness program in Lumaria, with actuarial justification and analysis. Our team proposes four main initiatives to reduce expected mortality, increase life insurance sales, add economic value for SuperLife, and incentivise healthy behaviours. These initiatives – namely Earn (financial incentives for healthy behaviours), Screen (preventative screening incentives), Prevent (cancer prevention initiatives) and Quit (smoking cessation programs) – will be offered via a SuperLife mobile app. This app will allow customers to log evidence of healthy behaviours, access rewards, and track their progress. 

Under StatSmart’s proposed plan, we expect SuperLife to have saved Č4.6B if they had implemented this program for the past 23 years. These savings arise from the decreased mortality risk that each program generates, which gives rise to lower benefit payouts and lower liabilities going forwards, as well as income from new policyholders attracted by the wellness program. 

A sensitivity analysis shows that the wellness program would have improved SuperLife’s economic value with almost 100% certainty. Key risks include participation risk, technology risk, pricing risk and ethical risks, among others. StatSmart has proposed several strategies for mitigating these risks by either reducing, transferring, removing, or self-insuring it. 

## 2.	Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
### 2.1 Main Objectives <a name="mainobjectives"></a>
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives:
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives: 
1.	Improve policyholder health and wellness through participation in the wellness plan
2.	Decrease expected mortality of policyholders 
3.	Increase sales of SuperLife’s life insurance products 
4.	Add economic value to SuperLife
5.	Increase competitiveness and marketability of products. 
While all five objectives are fulfilled through StatSmart’s proposal, the former three are the primary focus of the program design. The latter two objectives are achieved inherently: our findings show that the benefits of decreased mortality and increased customer base outweigh the program costs, leading to higher overall revenue, thereby providing SuperLife with higher economic value and better competitiveness than if this wellness plan had not been implemented. 

### 2.2 Key metrics & timelines <a name="keymetrics"></a>
The success of each incentive, and of the overall program, is primarily measured by the financial savings it would have afforded SuperLife over the past 23 years, relative to the status of no interventions. These savings consist of two parts: increased profits from current policyholders due to lower mortality causing reduced claim frequency, and additional profit from new policyholders joining due to the wellness program offerings. Naturally, the interventions all require cash outflows to fund their implementation and maintenance, but our calculations show that these expenses are outweighed by the savings. Next, timelines can be divided into setup, delivery and evaluation. The set-up of a mobile app to deliver the incentives, as explained in the following sections, will take conservatively 9 to 12 months considering its highly complex features (Srivastava 2023). Each individual incentive is then delivered through the app to the policyholders. Monitoring should be conducted regularly – for example every 3 to 6 months – to ensure that the app is well-used, taking on board policyholder feedback. Updates and general maintenance should occur continuously. The results of the program on policyholder mortality, claim pay-outs and new sales may take 2 to 3 years to be noticed, and even longer, up to 10 or more years, for the full effects to be felt. However, monitoring must still be conducted quarterly or even monthly to ensure assumptions are in line with expectations. 

### 3. Program Design <a name="programdesign"></a>
The StatSmart team have designed a program for SuperLife insurance that encompasses two incentive-based interventions and two mortality-based interventions. To decide on the best interventions, StatSmart performed a cost-benefits analysis on each of the 50 interventions, with the aim of identifying the top 10 interventions in terms of benefits for their respective cost. After selecting the top 10 using the cost benefits analysis, the team utilised the team’s exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the final four interventions. The final four interventions are outlined below.

### 3.1 Earn: Financial Incentives for Healthy Behaviour <a name="earn"></a>
Leveraging the rising trend of technology literacy in Lumaria, a gamified point system with financial incentives will be integrated within a new SuperLife app to encourage policyholders to live healthier lifestyles. Circulatory diseases are one of the leading contributors to policyholder deaths, responsible for 77% of all non-smoker deaths in the SuperLife dataset. The World Health Organization (WHO) (2015) states that more than 80% of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable by behavioural choices, including sustaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and blood pressure control via check-ups. As such, Earn aims to incentivise healthy behaviours to create long-term impact.

Earn will recognise six categories of healthy activities that when tracked and verified, allocates users with points, shown in table below. Each activity has a yearly limit according to the recommended frequency, for example, an annual health screening being sufficient for the general population. However, activities like walking 12,000 steps a day and purchasing fresh foods can be logged every day and every week respectively, as these healthy habits promote lifestyle change and address overall wellness by increasing activity rates and micronutrient intake.
