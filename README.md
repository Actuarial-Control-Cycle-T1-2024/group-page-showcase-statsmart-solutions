## Executive Summary <a name="executivesum"></a>
The implementation of “wellness programs” alongside life insurance products is becoming increasingly popular as the benefits become recognised by insurers and policyholders alike. These programs provide a way for policyholders to reduce their premiums or gain rewards by making healthier choices, and in doing so, decrease mortality risk for insurers and offer a means of attracting new customers. 

This report details StatSmart Solution’s proposals for SuperLife’s wellness program in Lumaria, with actuarial justification and analysis. Our team proposes four main initiatives to reduce expected mortality, increase life insurance sales, add economic value for SuperLife, and incentivise healthy behaviours. These initiatives – namely Earn (financial incentives for healthy behaviours), Screen (preventative screening incentives), Prevent (cancer prevention initiatives) and Quit (smoking cessation programs) – will be offered via a SuperLife mobile app. This app will allow customers to log evidence of healthy behaviours, access rewards, and track their progress. 

Under StatSmart’s proposed plan, we expect SuperLife to have saved Č4.6B if they had implemented this program for the past 23 years. These savings arise from the decreased mortality risk that each program generates, which gives rise to lower benefit payouts and lower liabilities going forwards, as well as income from new policyholders attracted by the wellness program. 

A sensitivity analysis shows that the wellness program would have improved SuperLife’s economic value with almost 100% certainty. Key risks include participation risk, technology risk, pricing risk and ethical risks, among others. StatSmart has proposed several strategies for mitigating these risks by either reducing, transferring, removing, or self-insuring it. 

## 2.	Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
### 2.1 Main Objectives <a name="mainobjectives"></a>
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives:
This health incentives plan aims to benefit SuperLife through five key objectives: 
1.	Improve policyholder health and wellness through participation in the wellness plan
2.	Decrease expected mortality of policyholders 
3.	Increase sales of SuperLife’s life insurance products 
4.	Add economic value to SuperLife
5.	Increase competitiveness and marketability of products. 
While all five objectives are fulfilled through StatSmart’s proposal, the former three are the primary focus of the program design. The latter two objectives are achieved inherently: our findings show that the benefits of decreased mortality and increased customer base outweigh the program costs, leading to higher overall revenue, thereby providing SuperLife with higher economic value and better competitiveness than if this wellness plan had not been implemented. 

### 2.2 Key metrics & timelines <a name="keymetrics"></a>
The success of each incentive, and of the overall program, is primarily measured by the financial savings it would have afforded SuperLife over the past 23 years, relative to the status of no interventions. These savings consist of two parts: increased profits from current policyholders due to lower mortality causing reduced claim frequency, and additional profit from new policyholders joining due to the wellness program offerings. Naturally, the interventions all require cash outflows to fund their implementation and maintenance, but our calculations show that these expenses are outweighed by the savings. Next, timelines can be divided into setup, delivery and evaluation. The set-up of a mobile app to deliver the incentives, as explained in the following sections, will take conservatively 9 to 12 months considering its highly complex features (Srivastava 2023). Each individual incentive is then delivered through the app to the policyholders. Monitoring should be conducted regularly – for example every 3 to 6 months – to ensure that the app is well-used, taking on board policyholder feedback. Updates and general maintenance should occur continuously. The results of the program on policyholder mortality, claim pay-outs and new sales may take 2 to 3 years to be noticed, and even longer, up to 10 or more years, for the full effects to be felt. However, monitoring must still be conducted quarterly or even monthly to ensure assumptions are in line with expectations. 

### 3. Program Design <a name="programdesign"></a>
The StatSmart team have designed a program for SuperLife insurance that encompasses two incentive-based interventions and two mortality-based interventions. To decide on the best interventions, StatSmart performed a cost-benefits analysis on each of the 50 interventions, with the aim of identifying the top 10 interventions in terms of benefits for their respective cost. After selecting the top 10 using the cost benefits analysis, the team utilised the team’s exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the final four interventions. The final four interventions are outlined below.

### 3.1 Earn: Financial Incentives for Healthy Behaviour <a name="earn"></a>
Leveraging the rising trend of technology literacy in Lumaria, a gamified point system with financial incentives will be integrated within a new SuperLife app to encourage policyholders to live healthier lifestyles. Circulatory diseases are one of the leading contributors to policyholder deaths, responsible for 77% of all non-smoker deaths in the SuperLife dataset. The World Health Organization (WHO) (2015) states that more than 80% of premature heart attacks and strokes are preventable by behavioural choices, including sustaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and blood pressure control via check-ups. As such, Earn aims to incentivise healthy behaviours to create long-term impact.

Earn will recognise six categories of healthy activities that when tracked and verified, allocates users with points, shown in table below. Each activity has a yearly limit according to the recommended frequency, for example, an annual health screening being sufficient for the general population. However, activities like walking 12,000 steps a day and purchasing fresh foods can be logged every day and every week respectively, as these healthy habits promote lifestyle change and address overall wellness by increasing activity rates and micronutrient intake.

All users automatically start at the Blue tier, where they can gradually rank up to Platinum, which has a reward worth Č80. At the start of a new year, all users’ tiers are reset to Blue, ensuring the maximum monetary reward is capped at Č80 and users are incentivised to complete annual check-ups. The points to Crown conversions were devised to match SuperLife’s provided intervention costs, while ensuring the activity effort required is proportional to the awards.
Based on the tier, customers can redeem rewards of a value up to the cost indicted in the table above. These rewards are from partnered businesses, which will initially start with shopping vouchers, wearable device discounts and flight cashbacks. Financial incentives through gamified app scenarios will encourage user satisfaction and participation, as well as improving life expectancy as seen in John Hancock’s ‘Vitality’ program (Vitality, 2018). See Appendix B.2 for more information on partnerships and benefits. 

### 3.2. Screen: Incentives for Preventive Screenings <a name="screen"></a>
The majority of the leading causes of death for SuperLife’s policyholders such as cancer and diseases of the circulatory system are preventable or can be delayed by undertaking preventive health screenings and check-ups. This is especially true when the factors and symptoms that can lead to disease may not be obvious, spotted early or seen at all until it is too late. Thus, health screenings allow policyholders to identify issues with their health before symptoms develop, to reduce risk (TAL, 2021). General health check-ups often include pathology tests such as blood tests which can also prevent diseases and identify risk factors, allowing doctors to provide advice and improve an individual’s health. Discovering diseases early will also increase the quality and length of life. 

Thus, one of the activities that is included in the rewards program is undertaking check-ups and preventive health screenings which will ensure a 5-10% reduction in mortality. The number of points awarded when a policyholder does a preventive screening or check-up allows them to automatically move up a tier. This allows them to get better rewards which will encourage participation in this intervention, but costs little to SuperLife as most screenings can only be done once every 2 years or more. 
SuperLife will only award points to policyholders if they get a general health check-up or a cancer screening, but only if they meet the criteria outlined in Appendix B.3.2. These screenings are for cervical, bowel, breast, lung and colorectal cancers. Please see Appendix B.3.1 on explanation as to why these cancers were chosen. Policyholders can gain points and thus financial rewards, by reporting through the app that they have done the preventive screening. This is done by consenting to share their private medical results and uploading documentation or results of their specific health screening. Otherwise, these medical examinations must be done at medical centres that have partnerships with SuperLife to confirm that the policyholders have done the screening in question.

### 3.3. Quit: Smoking Cessation Programs <a name="quit"></a>
Out of all potential interventions examined, the highest improvement in individual mortality arose from a smoking cessation program. Implemented effectively, this can reduce mortality by up to 50%. This program is accompanied by relatively high individual costs, but due to the low proportion of smokers in the policyholder population (on average 7% per year from 2001 to 2023), total costs are not excessive.   
In the United States (US), Babb and partners (2017) found that approximately 55% of smokers attempt to quit each year. However, even though quitting unassisted or “cold turkey” is only successful in 7-8% of cases, many smokers do not seek assistance in quitting due to lack of knowledge, high costs and insufficient insurance coverage of cessation programs (Caraballo et al., 2017; DiGiulio et al., 2018). This is where SuperLife can gain a competitive advantage in the Lumarian market: by offering fully covered, comprehensive smoking cessation programs, they will not only be improving the health, and thus mortality risk, of their current policyholders, but will also attract new customers seeking assistance in quitting smoking. 

SuperLife’s Quit will offer three components: counselling, access to medications, and referral to tobacco quitlines. Counselling sessions can be booked through the SuperLife app, along with information on financial coverage for medications that reduce nicotine dependence. The Surgeon General’s (2020) report showed that the combination of cessation medications and behavioural therapy through counselling is the most cost-effective method of smoking cessation. SuperLife should also provide policyholders with access to national tobacco quitlines, which are assumed to be offered and funded by the Lumarian government, as in most countries with similar economic standings to Lumaria (WHO, 2024). These quitlines are proven to be effective, and come at no extra cost to SuperLife or their policyholders (Fiore et al., 2008). Further details on Quit’s offerings and design can be found in Appendix B.4. 

### 3.4. Prevent: Cancer Prevention Initiatives <a name="prevent"></a>
Cancer is one of the highest contributors to mortality in Lumaria, where 33.47% of all deaths and 48% of non-smoker deaths in the SuperLife dataset can be attributed to cancer (C00-D48 - Neoplasms). To add to this, Prevent returned the most profitable numbers in the initial cost-benefit analysis conducted by the StatSmart team. Prevent has been designed to maximise participation and potential mortality improvements for SuperLife Policyholders. The StatSmart team designed Prevent with two different sections: the initiatives and the resources (to be called the ‘Cancer Prevention Hub (CPH)’. 

The initiatives will include a cancer fact released weekly with a different theme each quarter. Research conducted by the StatSmart team indicates that the most effective way to deliver this fact will be through a combination of a pop-up and a notification in the new SuperLife app (Appendix B.5). The pop-up will display the fact to the policyholder when they open the app for the first time since it has been released (once a week), with only the current week’s fact being displayed. When each fact is released, it will also send a notification to all policyholders who have the app downloaded, notifying them of the new fact. Included below the fact, will be a link to further resources in the CPH. A similar pop-up technique will also be created in the SuperLife website. An example of a pop up, would be ‘Melanoma is the most common cancer among young Australians’ (Cancer Institute NSW, 2022). Below this would be a link to multiple different articles put together by SuperLife related to skin cancer and the preventable risk factors behind it. The initiative themes will differ between each of the deadliest cancers in Lumaria and the nine key modifiable cancer risk factors (Appendix B.5). Each quarter, two different initiatives will be created to help the campaign be more targeted, as SuperLife will have the flexibility to adjust the theme based on the demographics of the policyholders.
The CPH will be established by SuperLife in year 1 and then updated yearly with any new information. Articles on new cancer research will also be added to the CPH throughout the year. A summary of all the articles to be included in the CPH can be found in Appendix B.5. Reading these articles will contribute to the point system outlined in the prior interventions.

To bring to life the program outlined above, it would be recommended that SuperLife forms mutually beneficial partnerships within the cancer industry. An example of this would be Munich Re’s partnership with GRAIL (2023), where Munich Re helped GRAIL with the clinical testing of the Galleri technology. A similar partnership could be formed by SuperLife, with them getting access to cancer research and statistics in return. Another idea could be to establish a partnership with Lumarian cancer charities and cancer related government organisations. 

### 4. Pricing/Costs <a name="pricencost"></a>
This assessment takes a conservative stance, concentrating solely on mortality savings and excluding potential interest from surplus, to precisely evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on mortality. Key formulas are outlined below, with more detail in Appendix C.5.

</p>

### 4.1. Overall Savings and Benefits <a name="overallsavings"></a>
The overall savings if the entire program was implemented between 2001 and 2023 would be Č4.6B. These net savings consist of Č6.5B in savings due to mortality improvement, less Č2B in total costs, which includes Č100M for app development (Russell, 2023). See Appendix E.3 and the supporting documents for more details on the full figures and modelling process. This program will also help SuperLife to generate an extra Č94M in savings from a 2% growth in customer base, as new policyholders are drawn by SuperLife’s unique and effective wellness program. This new business will be attracted via marketing schemes such as targeted advertisements on social media, referral programs from existing customers and community events with partner companies from the wellness program.

Figure 1 below summarizes the expected mortality savings – in Billion Crowns - from each intervention, in addition to the implementation costs: 

<p align="center">

</p>

Along with financial savings, this wellness program has several other benefits for SuperLife and its stakeholders. One inherent benefit is the overall health improvement for policyholders, and for Lumarians as a whole. Participating in health screenings, reducing cancer risk factors, decreasing smoking levels and doing healthy activities all promote better lifestyles for policyholders and for their relatives and friends who may also gain awareness of healthy behaviours. Further, this program directly helps SuperLife to practice Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by focusing on the needs of its customers (to live longer and healthier lives). This is not only ethical and beneficial to society, but also builds a better brand reputation for SuperLife. Finally, StatSmart’s proposed program would also improve employee satisfaction and engagement as they work with the knowledge that their products are helping others to improve their lifestyles. 

In the medium to long term, a key factor for SuperLife to consider is whether premiums can be reduced to reflect the improvement in mortality.  This may come in the form of overall re-pricing, or of variable premium discounts to policyholders based on their participation in the incentives. While this may reduce SuperLife’s premium income, it would likely boost policyholder participation, attract new customers, and improve the company’s brand reputation.

Consequently, we have recalibrated the mortality rates by applying a factor   of 88%, ensuring the mortality table aligns with the empirical data as a   baseline before applying any Mortality Improvements. This factor escalates to   811% when only smokers are modelled.                                                                                                                     |

Note that although the information   provided by SuperLife suggests a maximum mortality improvement of 50% for   smoking cessation, several studies globally have shown that 50% is in fact an   average improvement, supporting our use of this value as a best estimate   rather than an upper limit (US Surgeon General, 2020; Pierce, 2022)    |

This rate, weighted by the actual cash flows, effectively replicates   the present value that would have been obtained using the variable yearly   rates. This approach simplifies modelling and facilitates sensitivity   analysis.                                                                                                                                                    |

However,   it is mentioned that large companies spend millions of dollars a year to develop   and maintain apps. Therefore, a conservative estimate of 5,000,000 upfront   and 2,000,000 per year was calculated as the cost of the app.                                                                                                                                                    |


### 6. Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations <a name="risksmitigation"></a>
The program proposed by the StatSmart team offers SuperLife an excellent opportunity to financially benefit themselves, whilst also improving the lives of their policyholders. Despite this, it comes with multiple risks that could impact the overall profitability of the program. After considering these risks, the StatSmart team is almost certain that the proposed program would have lowered mortality over the last 23 years, and even more certain that it will decrease mortality going forward. This is backed up by the research completed by the team where there is no evidence of any similar interventions to the four proposed by StatSmart not decreasing the mortality rate. To add to this, the StatSmart team has also conducted thorough sensitivity analysis to confirm that there is a very low chance that this program does not create economic value for SuperLife.

### 6.1 Ethical Risks <a name="ethicalrisks"></a>

|     Risk                   |     Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Transparency Risk      |     SuperLife must inform users about how   sensitive data is handled, including how the data is collected, used and who   has access to it, including third parties. For example, users should be   informed about how their data issued if data is shared with partnered   companies.                                                                                     |     Privacy policies must be transparent,   informative, and easily accessible. Policyholders must be made aware of where   their data is being used, and whether it is being shared with third parties,   to prevent them from unknowingly sharing their data without understanding the   implications. SuperLife’s legal team can assist with this. Additionally, an   ethical framework must be developed to cover this and other ethical   risks.      |
|     Data Privacy Risk      |     Sensitive data will be collected from   individuals who participate in these programs, such as their medical records   used to claim points. Data breaches could lead to fraud, identity theft and   other regulatory and ethical issues.                                                                                                                               |     Along with the ethical framework, SuperLife   must implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data. Regular   tests and checks of this security system must be conducted. Sensitive data   should only be accessible for those who require it, and measures should be   taken to anonymise and remove or encrypt sensitive information when sharing   the data.                                                                           |
|     Consent Risk           |     While SuperLife’s app aims to encourage   healthy habits, policyholders may inadvertently reveal sensitive details   about their lifestyle, health conditions, or habits through logging their   activities for points. The trends revealed may not align with the terms and   conditions of the written consent form they fill out prior to participation.             |     As with the transparency risk, privacy   policies and consent forms must be clear and understandable for   policyholders. Policyholders should be fully aware of what they are   consenting to, and SuperLife should continually monitor the data they are   receiving to ensure that no unnecessary data is collected. Regulatory   guidance can also assist in this regard.                                                                          |
|     Discrimination Risk    |     SuperLife encourages participation in   healthy activities which may not be accessible to certain policyholders like   those with health conditions or disabilities. Policyholders with higher   socioeconomic status, better access to healthcare and more leisure time for   leisure are more advantaged in completing activities and thus financial   incentives.    |     As the wellness program is implemented and   further developed, SuperLife can add additional incentives targeted towards   these discriminated population groups, such as assistance with chronic   diseases. Further, premium discounts (which may be introduced in the future   of the wellness program) can make the program more accessible for those with   lower socioeconomic status.                                                           |

### 6.2 Main Risks <a name="mainrisks"></a>

|     Risk                     |     Description                                                                                                        |     Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Participation risk       |     The proportion of policyholders who   participate in the wellness program is significantly lower than expected.    |     The inherent design of the program to   target several different health-based incentives which can be personalised   per policyholder reduces the risk of low participation. The sensitivity   analysis shows that profits will still be made even if participation is lower   than expected. Data analytics and consumer feedback can be used to improve   participation once the program is implemented, if need be.     |
|     Mortality Impact Risk    |     The risk that the mortality impact of the   applied interventions is not in line with expectation.                 |     Monitoring mortality changes will allow   SuperLife to identify lower-than-expected mortality improvements.   Collaborating with doctors, wellness experts and researchers can provide   additional ideas on how to assist policyholders in reducing their mortality   risk.                                                                                                                                               |
|     Pricing Risk             |     The risk that the prices and costs   calculated by the StatSmart team are incorrect.                               |     Consistently (e.g. every quarter) monitor   premium income vs cash outflows to ensure expenses and income is in line with   expected; re-price if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     Technology risk          |     The program relies heavily on both the   development and ongoing maintenance of the app.                           |     IT specialists within SuperLife will need   to focus on ensuring that the app is working smoothly. Several redundancy and   backup mechanisms must be in place. In the event of critical system failure,   failover mechanisms and recovery protocols must be in place.                                                                                                                                                    |

### 6.3 Risk Matrix <a name="riskmatrix"></a>

### 6.4 Sensitivity Analysis <a name="sensitivity"></a>

The survival model utilized median scenario assumptions tailored for each intervention in the cost-benefit analysis, detailed further in Appendix C. Below, we present a comprehensive overview of the sensitivity analysis outcomes (full sensitivity analysis in Appendix E.3), focusing on pivotal assumptions that impact Net Savings.

|     Assumption                 |     Minimum Net Savings (000,000’s)    |     Maximum Net Savings (000,000’s)    |     Recommended Range                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Discount Rate              |     3,981                              |     5,117                              |     The   results are desirable for any range of discount rate if the cost and savings   are modelled using a consistent discount rate. The min and max scenarios were   1% higher and 1% lower than the provided discount rate (i.e. rates of 1.05%   to 3.05%)                                                               |
|     Participation Level        |     3,585                              |     5,801                              |     The   results are desirable within all the simulated participation levels, which   range from 18% to 60%, if the cost and savings are modelled using a   consistent participation level. The participation levels used for this   analysis can be found in Appendix E.3.                                                   |
|     Ongoing Costs              |     3,886                              |     5,906                              |     The   overall results are desirable within all the simulated cost levels, shown in   Appendix C.1-4. However, when evaluating each intervention solely, the cost   of the Financial Incentives program will exceed its savings only in the   high-cost scenario.                                                           |
|     Mortality   Improvement    |     2,405                              |     7,120                              |     The   overall results are desirable within the simulated mortality improvement   range, shown in Appendix C.1-4. However, when evaluating each intervention   solely, only the savings in the low mortality improvement scenario of the   Financial Incentives program will be insufficient to cover the program cost.     |

### 7. Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

|     Limitation                       |     Description                                                                                        |     Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Premium Data                     |     Data   relating to how premiums were priced, and their prices, was not included.                   |     Assumptions   were required to calculate the benefits of our interventions. It was   impossible to confidently use premium discounts as an incentive.                                                     |
|     Data definitions                 |     Data   definitions were not clear, especially in the srcsc-2024-interventions excel   document.    |     The   StatSmart team had to use their best judgement to define costs and mortality   improvements for their interventions                                                                                 |
|     Cause of Death                   |     Cause   of death data was quite broad, and was not specific to the exact illness.                  |     This   limited the StatSmart team’s ability to completely tailor their solution to   the country of Lumaria                                                                                               |
|     Lumaria   Encyclopaedia Entry    |     The   Lumaria encyclopaedia entry was not very easy to apply.                                      |     There   was no simple way to find similar economies to Lumaria. StatSmart used the US   as a comparison.                                                                                                  |
|     Policyholder   Data              |     There   was limited data on the policyholders.                                                     |     There   was very limited data that StatSmart could use to infer the mortality of the   policyholders.     There   was no policyholder behaviour data i.e. how much they used the SuperLife   website.     |
|     SuperLife   data                 |     There   was no data on SuperLife                                                                   |     It   was impossible to understand SuperLife’s full offerings and potential to pair   with other products.                                                                                                 |

Although there are various limitations imposed on our solution as stated above, StatSmart has used appropriate and realistic assumptions to mitigate this limitation and hence, our solution is justifiable and can be used. However, if Lumaria data does exist, StatSmart encourages SuperLife to rerun the model using it to see more accurate results. 

### 8. Conclusion and Next Steps <a name="conclusion"></a>

SuperLife will have an overall mortality saving of Č4.6B if this program was used in the past 23 years. We recommend SuperLife to perform several actions in the future to ensure profitability, attract customers and encourage healthy behaviour. These actions include using premium data to determine and incorporate premium discounts as part of the rewards for health behaviour and customer acquisition. SuperLife should also consider gaining more data on the factors that can affect mortality and use the cox regression model to isolate each covariate’s effects on mortality. Finding the exact causes of death will also allow SuperLife to determine a more specific action plan to decrease mortality through the reward program. Ultimately, we believe that our proposed wellness plan will not only benefit SuperLife, but also the community of Lumaria as a whole.

### 9. Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>

### 9.1. Appendix A - Exploratory Data Analysis (incl. Data Quality Check)

#### Findings:
An exploratory Data Analysis was done to understand the enforce data set prior to designing the program. We created dashboards that were used to slice the data and understand the characteristics of each group of policyholders. Here is a list of key findings:
-	Percentage of smokers significantly decreased throughout the Issue years 2001-2023 (T20 from 12% to 6%) and (SPWL from 10% to 0.3%).
-	Smokers are mostly Males under T20 Policy & are always classified as moderate or high risk. They mostly die due to Circulatory Systems while Non-smokers mostly die due to Neoplasms.
-	SPWL starts from age 35 and is mostly sold through an agent.
-	T20 starts from age 26 and is evenly distributed across the distribution channels.
-	The data is randomly distributed across all regions. No Region-specific anomalies were found.
-	Distribution Channels only correlate with the Type of Policy with no other anomalies.
-	Urban VS Rural are randomly distributed.
-	Underwriting Class is mostly correlated with Smoking Status, no other anomalies found.

#### Data Quality Check:
